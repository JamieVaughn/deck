1.) What does `DOM` stand for?
2.) The `DOM` is an API within Javascript:
```a) true b) false```
3.) What is the name of the object that is essentially the global scope in the browser?
4.) use `document.querySelector()` to select a `<p>` that is a direct child of a `<ul>` which is inside a `<main>`
5.) `document.querySelectorAll('div')` returns an HTMLCollection of `<div>`s
```a) true b) false```
6.) How would you create a new '<div>' element in javascript and save it in a variable?
7.) Provide one possible way you could append the variable from question 6 onto the `<body>`.
8.) How would you add a `click` EventListener to the `document` which logs the event object to the console when triggered?
